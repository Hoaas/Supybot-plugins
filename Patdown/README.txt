youhavedownloaded.com are monitoring some torrents on public trackers and records which IPs are downloading.
This plugin checks the ip given on that site. The plugin also accepts hostmask and nicks.
Nicks will only work if the nicks hostmask is one that will resolve to the correct ip.

That means givning a nick will not work on networks like QuakeNet where users often are logged in
and have hidden hostmasks like @mynick.users.quakenet.org.
