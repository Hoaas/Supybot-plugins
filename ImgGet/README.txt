This plugin listens for URLs. If an URL is posted, and the header confirms that it is in image, it might be downloaded.
It is downloaded if it matches the requirements for size (below a set limit). The size is only checked in the header, and might not be present.
If the size is not present the image is downloaded anyway.

There is also functionaly to output link to the image downloaded, if made available.
Automatic mirror output depends on some variables: time to download the image and the download speed on the image.
