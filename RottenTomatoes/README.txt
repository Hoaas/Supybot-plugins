Sadly you need an API-key. You can get one from http://developer.rottentomatoes.com. Put this in the config variable apikey for this plugin, like this:
@config supybot.plugins.RottenTomatoes.apikey yourapikeyhere

You might want to do this in a private message to keep it ... private.

Usage example:
00:58:20 <@Hoaas> !rt Dodgeball
00:58:22 <@Bunisher> Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story - Critics: 70% (Fresh). Audience: 75% (Upright). Proudly profane and splendidly silly, Dodgeball is a worthy spiritual successor to the goofball comedies of the 1980s.
