When someone posts a direct link to an image on facebook this plugin returns the name of the one who uploaded it to facebook, and an URL to the album it is in.
If you have access to the album depends on the the posters privacy settings.

If you leave auto checking off, this alias might be helpful:
Alias add face facestalk "[last --with .jpg]"

Then you can call 'face' and the last line in the channel that contained a .jpg will be sent as argument to this plugin.
