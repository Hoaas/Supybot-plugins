FacebookImage
-------------

Images from Facebook contains a user ID and an album ID in the URL.
This plugin uses those IDs to construct an URL directly to the user and album.
This can happen automaticly when someone posts an URL, or only when called manually.

If you have access to the album depends on the the posters privacy settings.

If you leave auto checking off, this alias might be helpful:
Alias add face facestalk "[last --with .jpg]"

Then you can call 'face' and the last line in the channel that contained a .jpg will be sent as argument to this plugin.
