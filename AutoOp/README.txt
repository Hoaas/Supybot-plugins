This plugin is hardly tested at all. There is no check if you input a proper regex or not. You probably shouldn't use it. Unless you know what you are doing.
This plugin autoops based on regex matching nick!ident@hostmask.

Can automaticly add hostmask for a user, but this is totally redundant.
It would be easier to use default supybot functionality for this.
