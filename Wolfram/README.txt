Hm. Yes. Found this plugin somewhere on the internets, then modified it. Haven't been able to locate the sources again. Don't think I have the original source anymore either. According to __init__.py it was written by Ed Summers.
Anyway, what it does is:
It queries wolframalpha, returns what the query was interpreted as, then the first line in the result. WA actually returns quite a lot at times, often over 30 lines, and often the answer you are looking for isn't the first result. But still works in most cases.
